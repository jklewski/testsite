											<h2>Travel and Accommodation</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Lund is located in southwestern Sweden, close to Malmö and Copenhagen. The closest and most convenient
											international airport is (CPH), marked in green on the map below. From Copenhagen there are direct trains (<a href="https://www.oresundstag.se/en">Öresundståg</a>) to Lund
											(follow “trains to Sweden/Malmö”) once every 20 minutes (approximately a 40-minute ride).
											Tickets are sold at vending machines by the exit to the trains or via the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.skanetrafiken.washington&hl=en">app</a>. Tickets are NOT sold on board.
											A ticket from CPH to Lund also includes local transportation in Lund (bus or tram) upon arrival.
										</p>
										<p>
											Once in Lund, the conference venue is located about 1 km from the central station. If you want to use public transport to get around in Lund, then your best options are 
											bus or tram line no. 1. The most convenient way to pay for public transport is to use the Skånetrafiken app. You can also travel to and from Malmö via Öresund trains, also operated by Skånetrafiken and available through their application. 
										</p>
										
										<p>
											Accommodation in Lund can be tricky, so please book your stay as soon as possible.
											There are several alternatives available near the conference venue. A selection of options have been highlighted with red markers on the map below. 
										</p>
										<p>
											If you rather stay in Malmö, then you can take a bus or train to Lund. The trains pass Hyllie, Triangeln and Malmö Central before departing to Lund. Trains leave approximately every 20 minutes.
